# Wii U Hacks Guide

Nintendo Wii U homebrew guide written by staff members of the [Nintendo Homebrew Discord server.](https://discord.gg/C29hYvh)

[The guide can be found here!](https://wiiu.hacks.guide/)


Note: The upstream devs of the Wii U Hacks Guide have decided to make a better version of an aroma guide, so this version is now not necessary anymore but I will leave it here so people can see what an original draft of the aroma guide would have looked like.

Note 2: I'm still going to be working on this even though the original PR isn't being updated yet. Who knows, maybe it could very well be used in the future.
